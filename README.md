## Setup
- Requires [ElasticPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elasticpress/)
- Once Elasticpress is setup and running, this plugin will automatically use the Elasticpress host settings so no additional setup is needed.
- Queries are sent directly to the cluster.  This allows raw queries to be tested and tweaked with your actual cluster data for eventual use in custom query filters.
